#' Compute a matrix of technical interactions.
#'
#' Based on landings and catches by species and gear, compute
#' a matrix of technical interaction values and main gear contributions.
#'
#' @param x a dataframe in the same format as the STECF data.
#' @param threshByCatch minimum tonnage for a species to be considered
#'        a by catch (default 5)
#' @param thresholdMainGear a threshold for including gears contributing 
#'        to co-catches, to retain only the gear with the greatest contribution
#'        set this to 1 (default is 0.8)
#' @param thresholdCoCatches a proportion giving the threshold for when 
#'        we decide that there is co-catches (default 0.5)
#' @param catchCoverage the propotion of total catch to cover in the tables
#'        i.e. 0.95 gives a table convering 95\% of the total catch (default 0.95)
#'
#' @return A list with four elements, technical interactions for landings (recapLand)
#'         and catch (recapCatch) and tables of main gears involved in the interactions
#'         based on landings (MainGearsLandings) and catches (MainGearsCatches)
#'
#' @note
#' 
#' Technical interaction appears between stocks when they are caught by the same 
#' gear during a fishing operation. Ideally the technical interaction should then 
#' be studied at the scale of the fishing operation to prevent artificially creating 
#' technical interaction between stocks that might only be caught at day/night or in 
#' different areas/timing of the year. However, often, the finest available information 
#' is per stock/gear/area/season. Knowing these limitations, the methodology used here 
#' consists in computing the sum of landings per strata of one species given that a 
#' second species is also present in the landings of this strata and then dividing 
#' this number by the total landings of the first species:
#'
#'  \deqn{T_{i,j}=\frac{\sum_s L_{s,j}*P_{s,j}}{\sum_s L_{s,i}}*100}{%
#'       T(i,j)=(sum_s L(s,j)*P(s,j) / (sum_s L(s,i) *100}
#'
#' Where T is the value of the technical interaction, i and j are the two species for 
#' which the technical interaction is assessed. P is an indicator variable and equals 
#' 0 if the total landings of a species for a for a given strata is less than 5% the 
#' total landings for that strata and 1 otherwise. L is the landings for a given 
#' species and strata.
#' 
#' Strata corresponds to the provided disaggregation of the landings.
