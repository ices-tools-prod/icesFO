```{r download_official_catch, cache=TRUE}
library(icesFO)

# download data
hist <- load_historical_catches()
official <- load_official_catches()
prelim <- load_preliminary_catches(2018)

# format / process
catch_dat <- format_catches(2018, "Baltic Sea Ecoregion", hist, official, prelim)
```

then the plot can be made:

```{r plot_official_catch}
# plot
p <- plot_catch_trends(catch_dat, type = "COMMON_NAME", line_count = 5, plot_type = "line")
p
```
